Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Deparment of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/), Washington University in St. Louis [(WashU)](https://wustl.edu/). I am on the 2025-26 job market.

My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics and international relations, focusing on authoritarian politics, public diplomacy, political communication, and political psychology. Much of my work centers on China and U.S.–China relations, while it also extends to Europe and other cross-national contexts.

Specifically, I investigate **how political elites use communication and development strategies to overcome public skepticism and build support for their rule and policies in both domestic and international environments**. My job market paper, which serves as the foundation for a book project, answers this question by examining how the Chinese regime responds to revelations of widespread corruption through the strategic use of _entertainment_ — a largely understudied dimension of the media landscape — to design engaging stories that weave detailed depictions of governance failures with positive portrayals of reform and progress for persuasion.

Methodlogically, I adopt a multi-method approach, including experiments, computational methods (text-as-data), design-based causal inference, qualitative content analysis, and interviews.

My research has been invited to R&R at the _American Political Science Review_ and _The Journal of Politics_ and has earned several recognitions, including the _Timothy E. Cook Best Graduate Paper Award_ (APSA 2024), the _Rebecca Morton Poster Award_ (NYU Rebecca B. Morton Conference on Experimental Political Science 2025), and the _Best Paper Award for the Foreign Policy Section_ (APSA 2022). It has also been generously supported by multiple institutions, including the [APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (DDRIG) Program](https://apsanet.org/programs/doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grants/), the [Institute of Human Studies](https://www.theihs.org/), and the [Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy](https://wc.wustl.edu/).


Prior to my PhD journey, I earned a Bachelor of Science in [Global China Studies (GCS)](https://www.shss.ust.hk/ug/major/gcs/) from [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and a Bachelor of Art in [Economics](https://www.waseda.jp/fpse/pse/en/) from [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/) in 2020. My undergraduate study was fully funded by the Ho & Ho Foundation and the [Bai Xian Asia Insitute (BXAI)](https://www.bxai.org/).
