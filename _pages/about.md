Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Deparment of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/), Washington University in St. Louis [(WashU)](https://wustl.edu/). Beginning in Fall 2026, I will join the [Division of Social Science at New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/social-science.html) as an Assistant Professor of Political Science.

My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics and international relations, focusing on authoritarian politics, public diplomacy, political communication, and political psychology. Much of my work centers on China and U.S.–China relations, while it also extends to Europe and other cross-national contexts.

Specifically, I investigate **how political elites use communication and development strategies to overcome public skepticism and build support for their rule and policies in both domestic and international environments**. My job market paper, which serves as the foundation for a book project, answers this question by examining how the Chinese regime responds to revelations of widespread corruption through the strategic use of _entertainment_—a largely understudied dimension of the media landscape—to design engaging stories that weave detailed depictions of governance failures with positive portrayals of reform and progress for persuasion.

I adopt a multi-method approach to advance my research, including experiments, computational methods, design-based causal inference, qualitative content analysis, and interviews.

My research has been invited to R&R/conditionally accepted at the [American Political Science Review](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review) and [The Journal of Politics](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/jop/current). It also earned several recognitions, including the Pi Sigma Alpha Best Paper by a Graduate Student Award (MPSA 2025), the [Timothy E. Cook Best Graduate Student Paper Award](https://apsanet.org/membership/organized-sections/organized-section-awards/past-awards/section-23/) (APSA 2024), the [Rebecca Morton Poster Award](https://wp.nyu.edu/cesspoliticalscienceconference/rebecca-morton-poster-prize/) (NYU Rebecca B. Morton Conference on Experimental Political Science 2025), and the [Best Paper Award for the Foreign Policy Section](https://apsanet.org/membership/organized-sections/organized-section-awards/past-awards/section-31/#paper) (APSA 2022). At WashU, I am the recipient of the [Provost’s Graduate Student Research Excellence Award](https://hereandnext.washu.edu/2024-research-excellence-showcase/) and the semifinalist of the [Dean’s Graduate Student Research Excellence Award](https://gradstudies.artsci.wustl.edu/deans-award-graduate-research-excellence-00).

My work has also been generously supported by multiple institutions, including the [APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (DDRIG) Program](https://apsanet.org/programs/doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grants/), the [Institute of Human Studies](https://www.theihs.org/), and the [Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy](https://wc.wustl.edu/).


Prior to my PhD journey, I earned a Bachelor of Science in [Global China Studies (GCS)](https://www.shss.ust.hk/ug/major/gcs/) from [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and a Bachelor of Art in [Economics](https://www.waseda.jp/fpse/pse/en/) from [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/) in 2020. My undergraduate study was fully and generously funded by the Ho & Ho Foundation and the [Bai Xian Asia Insitute (BXAI)](https://www.bxai.org/).
