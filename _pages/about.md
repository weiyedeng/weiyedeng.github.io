Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Deparment of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/), Washington University in St. Louis [(WashU)](https://wustl.edu/).

My research lies at the intersection of authoritarian politics, political communication, political psychology, and public diplomacy. It investigates a central question: **how do political elites garner support among the masses, particularly when facing skeptical or even hostile public opinion?** My job market paper, which serves as the foundation for a book project, answers this question by examining how the Chinese regime responds to revelations of widespread corruption through the strategic use of _entertainment_ — a largely understudied dimension of the media landscape — to design engaging stories for persuasion. they proactively weave acknowledgments of social or governmental failures into broader narratives of problem-solving and progress.

The other two papers in my dissertation, along with other solo and collaborative projects, advance this agenda by exploring **how political elites use nuanced communication strategies to overcome public skepticism and build support for their rule and policies in both domestic and international environments.** Beyond communication, I also study how states employ policy initiatives to foster political trust, especially in contexts where institutional legitimacy is weak.


Methodlogically, I adopt a multi-method approach, including experiments, computational methods (text-as-data), design-based causal inference, qualitative content analysis, and interviews.

Prior to my PhD journey, I participated in a Double Degree Program fully sponsored by the Bai Xian Asia Insitute [(BXAI)](https://www.bxai.org/). Through this program, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Global China Studies [(GCS)](https://www.shss.ust.hk/ug/major/gcs/) from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [(HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and a Bachelor of Art in [Economics](https://www.waseda.jp/fpse/pse/en/) from [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/) in 2020.
