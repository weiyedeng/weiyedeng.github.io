Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Deparment of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/), Washington University in St. Louis [(WashU)](https://wustl.edu/). I am on the 2025-26 job market.

My research lies at the intersection of authoritarian politics, political communication, political psychology, and public diplomacy. It investigates a central question: **how do political elites garner support among the masses, particularly when facing skeptical or even hostile public opinion?** My job market paper, which serves as the foundation for a book project, answers this question by examining how the Chinese regime responds to revelations of widespread corruption through the strategic use of _entertainment_ — a largely understudied dimension of the media landscape — to design engaging stories that weave detailed depictions of governmental failures with positive portrayals of reform and progress for persuasion.

The other two papers in my dissertation, along with other solo and collaborative projects, advance this agenda by exploring **how political elites use communication and development strategies to overcome public skepticism and build support for their rule and policies in both domestic and international environments.** 

Methodlogically, I adopt a multi-method approach, including experiments, computational methods (text-as-data), design-based causal inference, qualitative content analysis, and interviews.

My research has received an R&R at _The Journal of Politics_ and has been generously supported by multiple institutions, including the [APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (DDRIG) Program](https://apsanet.org/programs/doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grants/), the [Institute of Human Studies](https://www.theihs.org/), and the [Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy](https://wc.wustl.edu/).


Prior to my PhD journey, I participated in a Double Degree Program fully sponsored by the [Bai Xian Asia Insitute (BXAI)](https://www.bxai.org/). Through this program, I earned a Bachelor of Science in [Global China Studies (GCS)](https://www.shss.ust.hk/ug/major/gcs/) from [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and a Bachelor of Art in [Economics](https://www.waseda.jp/fpse/pse/en/) from [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/) in 2020.
